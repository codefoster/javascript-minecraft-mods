## Learn to Code with Minecraft and JavaScript

This repository contains some JavaScript mods for Minecraft.

The goal here is to use Minecraft as a way to learn basic coding skills. When you're learning to write a loop, would you rather watch text print to screen or blow up creepers? Yeah, I thought so.

To get your environment setup to run this, follow these steps:

* install Java from [java.com/download/](https://java.com/download/)
* follow the [this article](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/README.md) to learn how to install a custom Minecraft server on your machine that has the ScriptCraft mod ready to go
* clone this repo of my mods to your machine
* create a link of this repo in your ScriptCraft plugins folder
* code away

Feel free to create an issue on the Issues tab if you have any problems getting going.

> NOTE: there's more to come here to help you get started and a lot more to add to the code. Come back for updates, and you should always be able to `git pull origin master` in your cloned repo to get the latest changes.
